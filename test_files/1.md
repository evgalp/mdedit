>The main process is now broadcasting the name of the file and its contents over the
file-opened channel. The next step is to set up a listener on the file-opened channel
in the renderer process using the ipcRenderer module. Electron comes with two
basic modules for sending messages back and forth between processes: ipcRenderer
and ipcMain. Each module is available only in the process type with which it shares
a name.

> ipcRenderer can send messages to the main process. More important to our immediate
needs, it can also listen for messages that were sent from the main process using
webContents.send(). It requires the ipcRenderer module in the renderer process.
